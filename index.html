            To give more clearity ‚Äî I'm a data nerd, part-time overthinker, and
            full-time learner with an interest in digging into messy datasets,
            spotting patterns, and building cool stories & insights with code.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got into data science because I‚Äôm curious by nature ‚Äî from the
            beginning of my childhood days by always asking ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat
            if?‚Äù (<i>Again, I'm sorry Mom & Dad</i>) Whether it‚Äôs predicting
            basketball brackets, analyzing crime trends, or figuring out what
            drives user behavior, I‚Äôm all about finding meaning in numbers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I mainly work with Python, SQL, and tools like Datawrapper, Tableau,
            Altair or Matplotlib to bring stories out of data. Machine learning?
            Yep, I‚Äôve done some of that too. But what really excites me is using
            data to solve real problems or answer tough questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I‚Äôm not buried in a Jupyter notebook, I‚Äôm usually hanging out
            with my friends & family, watching day-to-day events and figure out
            trends, or play virtual / field sports like badminton, football (<i
              >US: soccer</i
            >) way too seriously.

        One goal that I look forward to achive in my lifetime is to visit as

      <p>
        Besides my interest in programming, web design and data analysis, I also
        developed an interest in various sports both on the field and virtually.
        These games have certainly helped me understand the essential factors
        that lead to the day-to-day events around the world; which I like to
        call the <b>"PPF toolkit"</b>. (Do let me know if you figure out what it
        is! üòÜ)
      </p>
      <p>
        While I was maily involved in playing sports like badminton, football &
        cricket, I also enjoy playing video games such as:

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          An arcade style flight simulator game set in the Pacific theater of
          World War II. It was released for PC, PS2, and Xbox published by
          Ubisoft in 2000 and is based on the battle events between the US and
          the then Japenese Empire in the Pacific Ocean from the surprise attack
          on Pearl Harbor in 1941 to the capture of Iwo Jima in 1945.
          Unfortunately, it's one of those games that nobody's ever heard of
          despite the fact that it was actually really, really good.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game provided a unique perspective of the effects of war on
          nations and individuals alike. The ways countries conduct A major
          takeaway that I was able to defer was that wars occur mainly because
          of the combination of two of the three reasons:
          <i>pride, greed & vengence. </i>

        <p>
          A real-time strategy game released in 1999, set in the Middle Ages and
          allowing you to build and manage their own civilizations, engage in
          warfare, and compete against other players or AI opponents. The game
          features various civilizations, each with its own unique technologies,
          and players can advance through different ages and view new abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the Aztecs, Incas, the Teutonic Order, Franks in the West, to the
          Khemer, Mongols and Japanese in the East; the game allows players to
          take control of real historical civilizations. This game has helped me
          sharpens critical real-world skills. At its core, the game demands
          strategic thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Players must analyze the map, scout opponents, and adapt their
          strategies on the fly. Choosing when to attack, when to defend, and
          how to allocate resources teaches long-term planning and the ability
          to make quick, informed decisions - much like solving real-life
          problems where time & resources management are constant challenges.

          From gang violence and politics to government espionage, police corruption,
           vice, and power acquisition, as well as real estate battles and bureaucratic 
           corruption, Rockstar North has masterfully explored the majority of these complex 
           themes in their game. The title presents a diverse range of protagonist perspectives, 
           each character bringing their own compelling backstory and unique mission arcs that 
           interweave to create a rich narrative tapestry.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game unfolds across meticulously crafted fictional cities that draw clear inspiration 
          from iconic real-world locations: Liberty City resembling New York, Los Santos 
          mirrors the sprawling landscape of Los Angeles, Las Venturas embodies the neon-lit excess of 
          Las Vegas, and San Fierro reflecting San Francisco. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Players can freely traverse these immersive rural & urban environments, engage with dynamic NPCs, 
          and tackle both primary story missions and optional side quests that add depth to the overall experience. 
          Drawing inspiration from countless films and television series, it's no surprise that Rockstar 
          has crafted what can only be described as a complete <b><i>masterpiece</i></b>.

        <p>
          The game follows the story of three <i>androids</i> (AI robots), Kara, Connor & Markus, who are trying to 
          find their way in a world where they are not considered equal to humans. The game helps in identifying and understand 
          the question in regards to AI: is this the beginning of a new species and are we ready to accept them as equals? Or will they 
          prove to be humanity's downfall?

          Thus, with a curiosity of learning the working of computer's and it's
          ability to perform multiple operations so effiiciently, I began my
          Undergraduate studies in the field of Computer Engineering. From where
          I built my foundations in programming languages like Python & Java
          along with my understanding the ways in which computers possess the
          abilitly of performing complex calculation through digital
          electronics, microprocessors etc.

        <p style="line-height: 1.5">
          This also introduced me to concepts like data mining , Warehousing &
          Data Analytics which introduced to the fundamentals of SQL and
          additional Python frameworks such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib etc.
          Through these tools I was able to find patterns and build visuals
          using various charts & graphs. With these skills, I was excited to
          figure out how I could leverage my skills to assist organizations in
          their daily operations which compelled me to pursue a Masters within

          warehousing, data mining, machine learning and data visualization
          along with the usage of various data tools like AWS, Datawrapper.
        </p>
        <p>
          The program has been a game-changer for me, giving me a better
          understanding of the mechanism of how predicitve algorithms work, and
          the identification of Key Perfomance Indices, how to storytell various
          topics using data and apply this knowledge to real-world problems
          within healthcare, . I also got to work with some amazing professors
          and classmates who really pushed me to think critically and
          creatively.

          <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5">
            Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a class of diseases that affects the
            heart or blood vessels (veins and arteries). It can be caused by a
            combination of socio-economic, behavioral, and environmental risk
            factors, including high blood pressure, unhealthy diet, high
            cholesterol, diabetes, air pollution, obesity, tobacco use, kidney
            disease, physical inactivity, harmful use of alcohol and stress.
            Family history, ethnic background, sex, and age can also affect a
            person‚Äôs risk of cardiovascular disease.

            The intricate symphony of life resonates with the echoes of
            molecular evolution. Proteins, the microscopic maestros, orchestrate
            cellular dances, their choreography shaped by eons of mutations and
            adaptations. In the arena of respiration, three seemingly disparate
            conditions ‚Äì asthma, COVID-19, and cystic fibrosis ‚Äì share the
            stage, each with its own poignant performance. Asthma, a chronic
            inflammatory waltz, disrupts the airflow with hyperactive immune
            responses. COVID-19, a viral invader, unleashes a macabre pirouette
            of cellular hijacking. And cystic fibrosis, a genetic mutation's
            cruel twist, thickens the mucus-laden atmosphere, impeding the vital
            exchange of gases.
